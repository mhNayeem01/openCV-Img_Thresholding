# openCV Image Thresholding Practice

This repository provides code and resources for learning and practicing Image Thresholding techniques using OpenCV. Image thresholding is an important image processing method used for segmenting images by distinguishing objects based on their pixel intensity.

***Repository Contents:***

**Thresholding Techniques PDF:** A detailed document explaining various thresholding methods and their theoretical foundations.

**Thresholding Code:** Code demonstrating the practical application of different thresholding techniques using OpenCV, 

including:

*Global Thresholding*

*Adaptive Thresholding*

*Otsu’s Thresholding*




***Prerequisites***

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed:


*Python 3.x*

**penCV (opencv-python)*

*Numpy*


To install the necessary libraries, use the following command:


bash:

*pip install opencv-python numpy*



**Learn from the PDF:**
To understand the theory behind image thresholding, refer to the 3 given Thresholding Techniques PDF included in the repository.


**Code Overview**

The repository includes a Python script, thresholding.py, that demonstrates several thresholding methods:


Global Thresholding: A fixed threshold applied across the entire image.

Adaptive Thresholding: A local threshold is computed for each pixel based on its surrounding pixels.

Otsu’s Thresholding: An automatic method that computes an optimal threshold for separating the foreground from the background in an image.


***Contributing***

Feel free to fork this repository, improve the code, and submit pull requests. Contributions are always welcome!
